## Testing

1 . Generation of Test Data:
Testing the developed features will require the generation of training and test data. We will be using the Blender rendering engine to generate the data. This will give us more control over what objects are in the water pipeline that the application needs to identify and will simplify testing in the early stages

2. Testing for Accuracy of Machine Learning Model:
We will conduct statistical tests to find the success rate of the applicationâ€™s in terms of accurately identifying sequences of images where there is anomaly
