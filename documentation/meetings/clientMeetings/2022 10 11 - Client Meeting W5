- Currently, there is no difference between admin users and normal users
    - We already know that there will be a difference between them in the future, so keep in mind that different privileges might occur.
    - Different actions for different roles.

- Performance
    - Execution time should be low, no fixed time for this, keep in mind that this interactive
        - Take a baseline reading, how much time does it take to filter through by hand
        - 
    - Accuracy of the learning algorithm, how good, how many iterations do we need to find all instances of the objects

- The sample image is the only format that the user is expected to submit (only that).
- Maybe it’s sufficient enough to store the label and the video path/name.
- Two different labels can be assigned to the same video.
- Django, ReactJS will be used

- Database is allowed for the project, and we can use the anyone’s that fit within our tech stack.
- The other option for not using Blender is actually get access to database
    - Concern with how real-life videos and blender rendering might cause the algorithm to not work efficiently.
    - However, Blender is easier to work with because there are already labels that we can use.
    - Further development will use Blender.
- The user is NOT uploading a vector of photos
