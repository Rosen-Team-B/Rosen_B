# 2022/10/20 - Client Meeting W6

- User uploads just one image
- AL queries the vector db for 10 images, and frames from the videos.
    - VGG16 creates a vector for the images, and we should map it to images
    - Images/Videos will be from our blender data, and hopefully from the company data.
- In the future, it would be possible to add different videos in the DB to be used for the algorithm. (THIS IS AN OPTIONAL FEATURE)
- The AL algorithm will return images, and the user has to be able to label and give the AL with a set of new images, and queries the DB for the images.
- There are two different ways we can specify the number of images that are returned:
    - Statically:
    - Dynamically: Scroll infinitely to get new images as they scroll down, only load as they scroll down.
