- User uploads just one image
- AL queries the vector db for 10 images, and frames from the videos.
    - VGG16 creates a vector for the images, and we should map it to images
    - Images/Videos will be from our blender data, and hopefully from the company data.
- In the future, it would be possible to add different videos in the DB to be used for the algorithm. (THIS IS AN OPTIONAL FEATURE)
- The AL algorithm will return images, and the user has to be able to label and give the AL with a set of new images, and queries the DB for the images.
- There are two different ways we can specify the number of images that are returned:
    - Statically:
    - Dynamically: Scroll infinitely to get new images as they scroll down, only load as they scroll down.
- The user will decide when to stop the back-and-forth algorithm running because after some time, either it will get so good that the classification will be correct, or they are satisfied with how detailed it is
- It is likely that the user will try to identify different things, such as fishes/AMEX Sealing, and so we could reset it, or BETTER, choose to save that instance of an object.
- A centralised DB that is hosted on the Rosen Network, or just a local DB,
- There are security reasons why running the script on their local systems, because of ROSEN security.
- So the algorithm can be trained/tested on separate videos found online
