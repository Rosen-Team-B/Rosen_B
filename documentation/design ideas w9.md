key points for the UI:
5 main pages: representing each step for the main tasks for the data scientists

Step1: video in DB  
- instructions: ask the data scientist (the main user) to check if the inspection video is in the database. Provide instructions to help them navigate to django/admin to check and add if needed.  
- next button: the data scientist will click the "next" button to go the next page. A warning pop up will show up saying there's no way to go back to the previous pages since that we are not planning to make a "back" button. It will mess up the work flow and the program.  
 
 Step2: parse the video to images  
- instructions: add instruction to describe what this step does.    
- "Parse the video" button: ask the data scientist click on the "Parse the video" button to parse the inspection video in the database into a lot of images.
- next button: the data scientist will click the "next" button to go the next page. A warning pop up will show up saying there's no way to go back to the previous pages since that we are not planning to make a "back" button. It will mess up the work flow and the program.  

Step2.5: loading page

Step3: vectorize images   
- instructions: add instruction to describe what this step does.  
- "Vectorize the images" button: ask the data scientist click on the "Parse the video" button to parse the inspection video in the database into a lot of images.    
- next button: the data scientist will click the "next" button to go the next page. A warning pop up will show up saying there's no way to go back to the previous pages since that we are not planning to make a "back" button. It will mess up the work flow and the program.
