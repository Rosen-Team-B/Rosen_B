key points for the UI:
5 main pages: representing each step for the main tasks for the data scientists

Step1: video in DB
	- instructions: ask the data scientist (the main user) to check if the inspection video is in the database. Provide instructions to help them navigate to django/admin to check and add if needed.
	- next button: the data scientist will click the "next" button to go the next page. A warning pop up will show up saying there's no way to go back to the previous pages since that we are not planning to make a "back" button. It will mess up the work flow and the program.
