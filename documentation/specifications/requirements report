Project Description
Detailed Introduction to the Project
The goal of the project is to develop a software system that enables Rosen data scientists to classify a large amount of images from water pipeline inspections in an efficient way. The classes should not be predefined by the software, instead they are defined by the userâ€™s decisions. The software system should be supported by an active learning algorithm that uses one of the VGG16 layers to vectorize images.
Project Perspective
This is a new project that does not have to replace or build on any existing systems within Rosen.

Users Regarding this Project
User profile 1: Main users
Job title: Data scientists in Rosen
Tech: Fluent in Python
Task: Given a section of the water pipeline inspection videos, make algorithms to classify images of objects.
Working style: Data scientists in Rosen work in a team per inspection video to make multiple algorithms. 2 groups per algorithm.
User profile 2: Potential users
Potentially, administrator.
Project should be built based on the knowledge of adding more users with different privileges.
